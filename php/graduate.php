<h2 class="description1"> John Armstrong</h2> 
<p class="intro1">
<span class="education"> Education</span><br>
<span class="education">334 Keeton House</span><br>
<span class="education">253-4691</span><br>
John was born and raised in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He went a few hours from home and earned a bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of Central Arkansas. After deciding he didn't want to be a medical doctor he left the south and went on an adventure for two years in Morocco working for the Peace Corps. Later he worked for Heifer International tending goats, water buffalo, a camel and other such farm animals in Central Massachusetts. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Education researching the history of Ithaca's town-gown relationship. Overall, the goal is to reconsider Cornell's land-grant mission as a radically democratic and decolonizing partnership. He enjoys telling good stories, listening to more, flying kites, and brewing beer. </p> </div>

<h2 class="description1"> Christina Black</h2> 
<p class="intro1">
<span class="education">English Literature</span><br>
Christina Black came to Cornell in 2012 to pursue her PhD in English literature, studying metaphors of the stomach in 18th c. British and French literature. If you want to be regaled with hours of conversation, just mention how you like to "think with your gut." Her interest has a practical bent as well, although she prefers if you do the cooking.<br><br>
An itinerant life means that where to call "home" is a choice for Christina. Having grown up with a parent in the Foreign Service, and subsequently worked in investment banking, bartending, several non-profits, and finally academia, she has lived in Italy, Poland, what was then West Germany, Yugoslavia-turned-Serbia, up and down the Northeast corridor of the U.S., France, the U.K., and South Korea. She is very glad to add Keeton House to that list.</p> </div>

<h2 class="description1"> Ivi Demi</h2> 
<p class="intro1">
<span class="education">Public Administration</span><br>
Ivi was born in the small Eastern European country of Albania and moved to the United States in 1996. He graduated high school in the rural upstate New York town of Catskill and went on to attend Cornell University for his undergraduate studies, receiving his B.S. in International Agriculture and Rural Development. Not wanting his time in Ithaca to come to an end, Ivi went on to pursue a Master's in Public Administration with the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs, specializing in Government, Politics, and Policy Studies.<br>
<br>
Ivi's work and travels have taken him to many developing countries around the world, including Kenya, Gabon, and Kosovo. He has interned with a political campaign, a research institute, a UN FAO field office, and a defense contractor. In his spare time, Ivi enjoys playing tennis, collecting and listening to old vinyl albums, and writing scripts for movies and TV shows with his older brother as they attempt to be the next great Hollywood directing duo. He's also a die-hard hockey and football fan as he hopelessly continues to cheer on the Washington Capitals and New York Jets.</p> </div>

<h2 class="description1"> Courtney Knapp</h2> 
<p class="intro1">
<span class="education">City & Regional Planning</span><br>
My name is Courtney and I'm a fourth year PhD Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning. I grew up moving back and forth between Stamford, Connecticut, and Fort Myers, Florida, and attended school in Boston, where I lived for eleven years prior to moving to Ithaca and starting at Cornell.<br>
<br>
I'm returning to Keeton after a year-long hiatus because I had been living and working/researching in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where my dissertation project is focused. In Chattanooga, I partner with a great social justice organization called Chattanooga Organized for Action (COA) on a project related to building just and sustainable creative and cultural economies across the city. During the past year we launched the SPARC (Sustaining People and Reclaiming Communities) Initiative and a Planning Free School, which runs community development workshops out of the public library. Chattanooga is a small but amazing city, with incredible history and a beautiful river and mountains; definitely check it out if you ever find yourself in the Southeast!<br>
<br>
Besides working on my dissertation, I enjoy exploring new cities by bike, camping, making music, missing my cats (who live with my mom in Florida while I finish school) and cooking delicious vegetarian/ vegan food. I'm looking forward to getting to know this year's Keeton crew!</p> </div>
