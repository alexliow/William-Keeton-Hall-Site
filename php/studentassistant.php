<span class="education">Biology & Society</span><br>	
Sydney was born in Kingston New York, and grew up in a small farming town right outside the city. She earned her Associates Degree in Liberal Arts: Math and Science from SUNY Ulster in 2009. After graduation she spent a year off, trekking through the Brazilian rainforest and along the Eastern Coast of the United States. She is currently a senior in CALS majoring in Biology and Society. She hopes to eventually pursue graduate school studying Neuroscience. For the past four years Sydney has spent her summers working at a camp for learning challenged children in upstate New York, and plans to continue working with this population throughout her lifetime.

	<h2 class="description1">Shiva Rajagopal</h2> 
	<p class="intro1">
<span class="education">Electrical & Computer Engineering</span><br>	
Shiva was raised in Fallon, Nevada, and is therefore not used to anywhere with a climate as cold as Ithaca's. However, he has made it to junior year of his Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad degree, so he'll get through the weather somehow. Shiva just spent his summer interning for Microsoft in Seattle, WA, and loves anything to do with computers (fixing, coding, assembling, all that fun stuff). In his spare time, Shiva is usually trying to keep himself occupied. Sometimes in Keeton, playing piano or eating in our dining room, and sometimes outside, playing tennis, ultimate Frisbee, swing dancing, or working out at the gym. He's always up to read a new book, watch a movie, learn a new skill, or any other fun activity. Because what else is life about, right?</p> </div>
