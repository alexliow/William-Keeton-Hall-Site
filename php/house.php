    <h2>History of the House</h2>
    
    <p class="filler">
    William Keeton House is the fourth of five houses on West Campus that are part of
    the Residential Initiative at Cornell University. The House was named in honor of
    Cornell faculty member William T. Keeton and accommodates continuing undergraduates and transfer students who wish to live on the Cornell University campus in a
    faculty-led student-governed residential house<br>
   <br>
    The House has its own dining room, leisure common area, library, pantry, guest
    suite and rooms for computing, seminars, academic support, and programs, engaging
    faculty, students, and staff in an environment of collegiality, civility, and
    stewardship.

            <p> Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Faculty 1958 &minus; 1980</p>
        
        <p> William T. Keeton (February 3, 1933 &minus; August 17, 1980)was a beloved professor, known for his enthusiasm for research
        and passionate teaching style. </p>
        <p> Because of its popularity on campus, his introductory biology class became known
        simply as &#34;the Keeton course&#34;.  His lectures for this course were often standing-room
        only, with students flowing into the hallway to hear his spellbinding presentations. </p>
        <p> In 1967, he wrote the textbook Biological Science, which introduced thousands to
        an integrated view of biology that used evolution as a unifying theme.  This book
        influenced untold numbers to take up the profession of biology.  </p>
        <p> He was an international leader in studies of animal orientation and navigation,
        and his laboratory and the Cornell pigeon lofts attracted visiting students and
        scholars from around the world. </p>
        <p> His lifelong enthusiasm for pigeons led to his groundbreaking research on how
        homing pigeons find their way home.  This research set the standard for the field and
        influenced generations of behavioral biologists.</p>

    <h2>The Keeton House Crest</h2>
    <img id="seal" src="../images/logo2.gif" alt="keeton seal"/> 
    <p class="filler">
   
Thematically, the House Crest is inspired by Professor William Keeton’s scientific discovery 
that homing pigeons’ remarkable ability to find their way in nature is due to their use of multiple 
points and processes of navigation. Prior to his work, researchers were looking for that one thing 
that explained it all. The different tools of avian route finding (such as meteorology, geography, 
magnetism, celestial cues) are thus mutually complimentary. All matter, but none matter alone. <br/>
 
Keeton’s scientific conclusions inform the spirit of the house named in his honor. The 
humble pigeon offers a way for students to think about one of life’s most challenging problems: the 
complexity of finding one’s way. Keeton’s research reminds residents how important it is to eschew 
any single point of reference, identity, data point, or path in order to use all of our senses, all of our 
information, all of our tools for living and learning in order to find our way intellectually, morally, 
and socially. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the unifying symbol of the official crest is an eight-pointed compass, suggesting 
the theme of lifelong navigation and discovery. The compass is woven into a circle labeled Cornell 
University, representing how that process is enmeshed within this much larger place of learning. A 
pigeon, symbol of flight, of homing instincts, and of our namesake’s research, alights toward the 
western needle of the compass where the William Keeton House logo can be found. At the heart of 
the crest lies an open book, upon which are inscribed three Latin words: <br>
<br/> 
Conscientia: consciousness, awareness, and knowledge <br/>
Colligere: to assemble, to collect <br/>
Cognoscere: to find out, to learn, to get to know <br/>
<br/> 
Those words, and the symbols that surround them, help guide residents toward fulfilling the 
mission of uniting the living and learning experiences at William Keeton House.
