<p>       In 1980, Steve was searching for an academic position and,
knowing little about the U.S. universities that had offered him positions, he called an eminent
American psychologist at Stanford to ask which of the offers he should accept.<br><br>The eminent psychologist
was not in, so Steve left a voice message. Later that day, when checking his own voice mail, Steve
heard the brief return message: “Take Cornell!” Steve did and he has remained at Cornell ever since,
save for a few visiting professorships he has taken around the world.<br><br>
  Although children’s courtroom testimony is a core research area, and Steve leads a large lab group
of graduate and undergraduate students studying this topic, he has interests in several other areas
of psychology, especially gender differences in mathematical and spatial reasoning, and intelligence
more generally. He has published over 300 articles, chapters and books, many with his partner Professor
Wendy Williams. They have three daughters, the oldest of whom, Nicole Ceci, was a graduate fellow at
Keeton House last year.<br>

-- and to be open to new opportunities (ask me sometime about all the random stuff that led from music ed to
Cornell).<br>
<br>
I've been interested in online behavior for a long time, especially what we can do with the traces we leave
online around what we say, what we buy, where we go, and who we talk to.  For instance, companies like Amazon
and projects like Wikipedia can look at what we watch or edit in order to learn what we like and recommend
other things we might want.   Or researchers might look at  aggregated behavior in Wikipedia, Facebook, or
Twitter to understand collaboration, how friendships are expressed online, or how people disclose personal
information and disseminate news. And, most interesting to me these days, I want to explore how people can
use their own past data to better understand themselves and their relationships with other people.<br>
<br>
This kind of work is cool because you need to think about the people, the technology, and the potential
social consequences both to figure out what's going on and to build useful things that don't creep people
out or cause unintended downstream consequences like employers checking out your Facebook.  Much of what I
teach ties to this work, especially the Human Computer Interaction and Advanced HCI classes (INFO/COMM 3450
and 4400).  Outside of school, there's a lot of disc golf, kayaks and biking, cross-country skiing when snow
is available, three cats, and a dog. </p>

 Jeff was born in Washington, D.C., lived in Uruguay as a young child, moved back to northern Virginia, then to Venezuela for three years before returning to the D.C. suburbs for high school. He received his B.A. from the College of William &amp; Mary, before becoming a midwesterner through graduate studies at Indiana University (where he met his wife, Jane) and postdoctoral work at Washington University in St. Louis. That he is a fan of IU basketball and Cardinals baseball is attributable to this period; his development as a hockey fan(atic) only occurred in the last dozen or so years, at Lynah Rink. <br>
<br>
Being a botanist and married to a farmer’s daughter, it was perhaps inevitable that Jeff would become a gardener. He now spends most of the all-too-short Ithaca summer weeding and building new flowerbeds instead of hiking, and his bird watching (a life-long enthusiasm) is thus mostly confined to enjoying visitors to the many feeders in the yard. He is the sworn enemy of slugs, squirrels, deer, and woodchucks. Playing guitar is another favorite pastime, as is reading pretty much anything he can find. </p>

His primary field is the study of plant chemical responses to environmental stressors such as herbivorous insects. His research stretches all the way from studying plants and insects in natural systems in the field to the chemicals that these organisms produce. In particular he is interested in the nature and ecological consequences of chemical signaling between organisms, which has major implications for the understanding of the dynamics and composition of ecological communities, as well as for the development of biological and sustainable means of pest control in agriculture.

Because studying organisms in their native environments is crucial to his work, his research has brought him to some of the most exciting places in the world, including the rainforests of Borneo, Costs Rica and Colombia, the Central Siberian rivers, the dry western slopes of the Andes in Peru, the Great Basin desert of Utah and the diverse oldfield habitats of upstate New York. He believes that the primary sources of scientific innovation and energy that keeps a research project interesting and vibrant are the open minds of undergraduate and graduate students and the careful observation of biological interactions in nature.

<p>in Economics. Even though she loved economics, she felt uncomfortable about the fundamental premise that people are rational, so she dove into the study of psychology which focuses much more on all the ways that people are not driven by reason. Ultimately, she discovered the field of Industrial/Organizational Psychology which she saw to be a nice blend of the two and received her M.A. and Ph.D. in it from the University of Maryland.
<br><br>

Lisa is half Japanese and half American, born and reared in Tokyo until she came to the U.S. for college. She has been deeply influenced by the many formative years that she spent in diverse multicultural schools, and this is evident in her research. She continues to search for the blend of organizational practices, leadership, group norms, and cultural values that enable diverse groups to avoid stereotyping and prejudice and instead functional optimally. She is also very passionate about social cognition in organizations – the idea that employees perceive, interpret, and experience their organizational lives quite differently depending both on their local contexts and personal backgrounds. She regularly publishes in management journals and presents her research at domestic and international conferences. Lisa loves getting to know her students, and this is reflected in the fact that she was the first ILR professor to receive the university’s Kendall S. Carpenter Memorial Advising Award, and is the only assistant professor to have won two ILR teaching awards.

<br>
<br>

In her free time, Lisa enjoys hanging out with her two children (Elise and Issei) and husband Ray, dancing to house music with them, cooking, traveling, speaking Japanglish, and taking students out to lunch

He worked at the RCA Space Center in East Windsor, N.J. from 1979-1982, where he served as a mechanical design engineer on the TIROS meteorological satellite program. He has taught at Cornell since 1986. He spent 2 of his sabbatical leaves as a Lady Davis fellow in the Aerospace Faculty of the Technion in Haifa, Israel. His current research interests encompass estimation and filtering, GPS/GNSS receivers and related navigation applications, GPS-based remote sensing, and spacecraft attitude and orbit determination. He has been the principal instructor for the junior-level M&amp;AE course "System Dynamics" since 1999. His recent graduate teaching assignments have included the courses "Theory of Linear Systems" and "Model-Based Estimation." He has received various professional awards, including teaching and advising awards from the College of Engineering. He is the faculty advisor for the men's lightweight crew team and the chairman of the University ROTC Relations Committee.

<br><br>

Psiaki grew up in Wyckoff, N.J., which is located 14 miles northwest of the George Washington Bridge, a place where people drink "wooder" when they are thirsty. He met his wife, Mary, while they both were working as engineers at the RCA Space Center. They have 9 children. Three of them are Cornell graduates, and one is currently a Cornell sophomore. Another graduated from West Point. Their youngest four are still at home.

<br>
<br>

Psiaki's hobbies and interests include biking and hiking, working out at Teagle, watching "chick flicks" with his wife and younger daughters, reading aloud to children (especially adventure, fantasy, and biography), and playing jazz/pop piano (not very well). He became an evangelical Christian after a youth spent in the Episcopal church and after teenage/young-adult years spent as an Ayn-Rand atheist. He is interested in Christian apologetics and the interplay between science, reason, and faith.

While believing humans are not specialists*, but rather should be prepared to meet the possibilities of life with a ready mind and able hands, he does not miss the irony of being a Senior Lecturer and Senior Extension Associate in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, where his areas of interests include spatial dynamics and properties of the environment with particular focus on anthropogenic contaminants, management and cultivation systems for food production in human disturbed environments as well as the nature and characteristics of soil. In Jonathan’s attempt to balance his teaching, extension and research activities with the larger world he has also become a  husband, father, gardener, dreamer, designer, builder, demolisher, outdoorsman, student, teacher, sailor, brewer, teammate, chef, gamer, orienteer, leader, follower, - all of which (he believes) are related, integrative and reinforcing – though not necessarily at the same time. He can also change diapers.

<p>about these issues.  My background is in computer science and cultural studies, and I am a big fan of interdisciplinary studies, especially ones that cross over between so-called 'soft' topics around culture and society and 'hard' topics related to technology, engineering, and design.

<br><br>

My primary work looks at the history and experiences of a very small, traditional fishing community off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, which has only very recently joined mainstream consumer culture.

<br>
<br>

By studying the practices, experiences, and perspectives of these islanders, I am gaining understanding of what it means to "be modern", and using the results to identify new design opportunities for computing.  This study inverts common ideas of traditional, rural lifestyles as being 'behind the times' - in some ways traditional communities have clearer insights into where we should or could be heading than modern communities engaging in an unreflective race towards the 'new.'

I live about a block from Keeton House with my family, including my two young daughters Netta and Tova.  I like to play with my kids, lift weights (you might see me at Noyes), play ultimate frisbee, and cook. I am a big fan of the outdoors and spent the summer before I started at Cornell backpacking across Alaska.
